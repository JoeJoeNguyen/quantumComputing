This repository is dedicated for learning Qiskit
 - Building quantum Circuit and Project
    - Constructing Classical Gates using Quantum Gates 
    - Quantum Teleportation using Qiskit

 - Variational Quantum Classifier for Iris Dataset - Quantum Machine Learning

    - Developed a quantum machine learning model using Qiskit to classify the Iris dataset, focusing on sepal length and width features.
    - Designed and implemented a variational quantum classifier (VQC) with a custom feature map and variational circuit to perform multi-class classification.
    - Trained the model using the SPSA optimizer.
    - Visualized data distribution, model predictions, and classification errors using Matplotlib to evaluate and communicate model performance.
